Object oriented programming.

##Class:
* A class is a defined structure to create an object.
It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of one type.

##Object:
* An object is an instance of a class.
It has state (data) and behavior (code).

##Constructor:
* Special method that initializes a newly created object,
it can accept arguments that the constructor uses to set required
member variables. The number of the arguments and the order matter
when instantiating an object.
