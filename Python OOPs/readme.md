Object oriented programming.

##Class:
* A class is a defined structure to create an object.
It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of one type.

##Object:
* An object is an instance of a class.
It has state (data) and behavior (code).

##Constructor:
* Special method that initializes a newly created object,
it can accept arguments that the constructor uses to set required
member variables. The number of the arguments and the order matter
when instantiating an object.

##Inheritance:
* Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class,
retaining similar implementation.

##Encapsulation:
* Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that 
work on that data within a class. This concept is also often used
to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside.
The main idea is to protect data from being modified from outside the class.
* A protected variable can only be accessed by the parent and child classes.
* A private variable can only be accessed through the class itself.
